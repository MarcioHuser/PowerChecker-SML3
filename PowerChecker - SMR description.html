With this mod you can place down a monitor to verify if your current power production
can run your factory at 100% without tripping the fuse.

It is Multiplayer compatible. Many thanks to <a href="https://ficsit.app/user/81X6ThXd2MA3ro">TwoTwoEleven</a> (<a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/B9ZnQrrWf5rdPp">Micro Manage</a>) for the orientations on how to get it working üòÄ

    <li>How much power is currently being consumed;</li>
    <li>The maximum amount of power the circuit will consume if everything runs at the same time;</li>
    <li>How much power you have to spare at the circuit.</li>
    <li>When interacted it will show a popup with the same stats, plus a list of all the generators and consumers of the circuit, grouped by:
        <ul>
            <li>Type</li>
            <li>Power generated/consumed</li>
            <li>Overclock</li>
        </ul>
        It will also show the sum of consumed/generated power of each building group
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How dows it work:</h3>
The screen and the power light will change color according to the given statuses:
<ul>
    <li>If the maximum amount is greater than the maximum capacity, the panel will show red and the power light will blink with red color.
